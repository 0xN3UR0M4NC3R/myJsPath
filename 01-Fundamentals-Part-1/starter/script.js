/*
- Types of decleration keywords (let, const, and var).

- Changing a variable later in the code is called "Mutating" just like in python.

- Decalre a string literal like inn python except you do it with backticks``

- let myString = `Hi I am ${myName}`;

- if (){    written this way
    
}
    else if (){
    
    }
    else {

}

- To convert types Number(), String(), Boolean(),
console.log('1' + 1 + '3') would result in a 4 cuz addition turns strings into a number(Type coerstion).

- Type of NaN is Number (NaN = Not a Number).

- Falsy values are: False, 0, NaN, '', undefined, null. Else everything is Truthy Value.

- '10' == 10 would result in a true (=== strict equality operator doesn't do type coertion and == is the loose equality operator does type coertion)
AVOID LOOSE EQUALITY OPERATOR WHEN COMPARING

- != loose nequal !== strict nequal. Avoid loose.

- Prompt: (input() in python) reveals a prompt field for the user to write an input in it.
